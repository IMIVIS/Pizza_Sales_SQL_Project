# Pizza_Sales_SQL_Project

ðŸ“¦ Pizza Sales Analysis SQL Project

This project is a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of a pizza sales database. The objective is to design, implement, and query a relational database schema that simulates real-world pizza ordering patterns. The project demonstrates database design, query optimization, and data aggregation using SQL, covering basic to advanced analytical use cases.

âœ… Schema Overview

The database consists of the following tables:

orders â€“ Records customer orders with timestamps.

order_details â€“ Contains details of each order, including pizza type and quantity.

pizzas â€“ Stores pizza-specific information like size and price.

pizza_types â€“ Defines different pizza types, their categories, and ingredients.

Relationships between tables are built using primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and reflect real-world interactions.

ðŸ“Š Key Objectives & Queries

The project includes queries categorized by complexity:

Basic Analysis: Total orders, revenue calculation, highest-priced pizza, common sizes, and top pizza types.

Intermediate Analysis: Category-wise ordering trends, hourly distribution, date-wise averages, and revenue rankings.

Advanced Analysis: Revenue contribution percentages, cumulative trends over time, and category-based top pizza rankings.
